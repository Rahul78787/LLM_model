Rahul Store: Enhancing Database Interaction with AI

Rahul Store is a project that leverages advanced language models, specifically Google Palm and Langchain, to facilitate natural language interaction with a MySQL database. This system is designed for a T-shirt store named Rahul Store, which maintains its inventory, sales, and discount data in a MySQL database. Store managers can pose natural language questions about their inventory, such as the number of white Adidas T-shirts remaining in stock or the potential revenue from selling all extra-small T-shirts after applying discounts. The system intelligently translates these questions into SQL queries and executes them directly on the MySQL database, providing quick and accurate responses to the user's inquiries.


Project Highlights
Rahul Store is a T-shirt retailer that offers products from popular brands such as Adidas, Nike, Van Heusen, and Levi's. The store manages its inventory, sales, and discount data using a MySQL database. We are developing a language model-based question and answer system that utilizes the following technologies:

Google Palm LLM for processing natural language queries
Hugging Face embeddings to generate textual representations
Streamlit for creating an interactive user interface
Langchain framework to facilitate the integration of LLM with database operations
ChromaDB for storing vector data
Few-shot learning techniques to enhance model performance with minimal data
In the user interface, a store manager can input questions in natural language, and the system will intelligently produce the corresponding answers by querying the database.
